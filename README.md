# Sample WebSocket Chat Room App

Using Socket.io and Express.js(app without the express generator templates).

## Run the example app

```
$ cd socket-chat
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The app will start on port `3000` on you local machine.

Append /nickname to display your nick name in chat room. e.g. Open the app in brower as `http://localhost:3000/john`. Open multiple windows with different nickname to see the magic of sockets!
